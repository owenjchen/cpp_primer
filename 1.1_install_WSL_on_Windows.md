# Set up WSL on Windows

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows.

install everything you need to run WSL with a single command. Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator", enter the following command:

    wsl --install

When it is done, restart your machine.

## Set up your Linux username and password
Once the process of installing your Linux distribution with WSL is complete, open the distribution (Ubuntu by default) using the Start menu. You will be asked to create a User Name and Password for your Linux distribution.

This User Name and Password is specific to each separate Linux distribution that you install and has no bearing on your Windows user name.

Please note that whilst entering the Password, nothing will appear on screen. This is called blind typing. You won't see what you are typing, this is completely normal.

Once you create a User Name and Password, the account will be your default user for the distribution and automatically sign-in on launch.

This account will be considered the Linux administrator, with the ability to run sudo (Super User Do) administrative commands.

Each Linux distribution running on WSL has its own Linux user accounts and passwords. You will have to configure a Linux user account every time you add a distribution, reinstall, or reset.

## Reset your Linux password
To change or reset your password, open the Linux distribution and enter the command: 

    passwd

You will be asked to enter your current password, then asked to enter your new password, and then to confirm your new password.

If you forgot the password for your Linux distribution:

Open PowerShell and enter the root of your default WSL distribution using the command: wsl -u root

If you need to update the forgotten password on a distribution that is not your default, use the command: 

    wsl -d ubuntu -u root

Once your WSL distribution has been opened at the root level inside PowerShell, you can use this command to update your password: 

    passwd <username> 

where <username> is the username of the account in the distribution whose password you've forgotten.

You will be prompted to enter a new UNIX password and then confirm that password. Once you're told that the password has updated successfully, close WSL inside of PowerShell using the command: exit.

## Switch WSl default user to root
Another method to reset your WSl password in case you forgot it, is to switch the default WSL user to root.  Root user is the admin user and it does not have any password in WSL.  Open a Windows Power Shell and run this:

    ubuntu config --default-user root

After this change, open a Ubuntu Bash shell in Windows Terminal, you can run all commands.  To change the password of the regular user account you fogot, type this:

    passwd <username>

Replace <username>  with your actual user name.

Once you are done, you can switch the default WSL user back to the regular user:

    ubuntu config --default-user <username>

## Set up Windows Terminal
Windows Terminal can run any application with a command line interface. Its main features include multiple tabs, panes, Unicode and UTF-8 character support, a GPU accelerated text rendering engine, and the ability to create your own themes and customize text, colors, backgrounds, and shortcuts.

Install Windows Terminal or Windows Terminal (Preview) from the Microsoft Store

## Update and upgrade packages

    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade   


# Install C++ Compilers and other C++ Building Tools

## Install g++, make and dgb
From the command prompt, install the GNU compiler tools and the GDB debugger by typing:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb

Verify that the install succeeded by locating g++ and gdb. If the filenames are not returned from the whereis command, try running the update command again.

    whereis g++
    whereis gcc
    whereis make
    whereis gdb

## Install clang and cmake

    sudo apt-get install clang cmake

# Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Visual Studio Code (VS COde) is an open-source version of Microsoft Visual Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  It is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.   It supports almost all programming languages, including JavaScript, C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go etc.

We will use VS Code as the IDE for our C++ course.

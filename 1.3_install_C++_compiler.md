# Install C++ Compilers and other C++ Building Tools

## Install C++ Compiler on Windows
We will use g++/gcc compiler on Windows and will use GNU make for a make file.

Open a WSL terminal. From the command prompt, install the GNU compiler tools and the GDB debugger by typing:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb

Verify that the install succeeded by locating g++ and gdb. If the filenames are not returned from the whereis command, try running the update command again.

    whereis g++
    whereis gcc
    whereis make
    whereis gdb

## Configure VS Code on Windows
**Prerequisites:**
make sure that you have done the following 3 steps first:

- [Install VS Code](#1.2_install_VS_Code.md)
- [Install WSL on Windows](1.1_install_WSL_on_Windows.md)
- [Install C++ Compiler](#1.3_install_C++_compiler.md)

Follow the instructions on this page to configure VS Code on Windows:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-wsl

## Install clang and cmake on Mac
If you are using a Mac, we will use clang as C++ compiler and cmake for a make file.

### Install xcode-select
First install Apple xcode-select.  Run the following command from a terminal:

    xcode-select --install

The above command will install C++ compiler clang

### Install homebrew
Homebrew is a package management software for Mac.
See this Homebrew page for more information:
